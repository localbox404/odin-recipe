    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its layers of rich flavors and textures. It is typically made 
        with wide, flat pasta noodles, layered with various ingredients such as tomato sauce, minced meat 
        (commonly beef or pork), ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and sometimes vegetables like 
        spinach or mushrooms. The layers are usually topped with a final layer of cheese and baked until 
        the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the edges are crispy. Lasagna is often seasoned with herbs 
        like oregano, basil, and garlic, adding depth to its savory profile. It's a hearty and comforting dish 
        that is popular worldwide, enjoyed as a main course for family dinners, gatherings, and special 
        occasions.
