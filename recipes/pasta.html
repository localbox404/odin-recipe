    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>Homemade Pasta Bolognese is a beloved Italian classic that speaks to the heart of traditional 
        cooking. Picture a scene in a cozy kitchen, where flour and eggs are meticulously kneaded into a 
        smooth dough, rolled out with care, and cut into thin strips or comforting shapes. These 
        homemade pasta creations, tender and yielding, serve as the perfect canvas for the star of the 
        dish: the rich Bolognese sauce. This sauce, simmered to perfection, embodies a depth of flavor 
        that comes from a careful balance of ingredients. Ground meats, slowly cooked with aromatic 
        vegetables, tomatoes, and a medley of herbs and spices, create a symphony of savory notes that 
        dance on the palate with each mouthful.
    </p>
    <p>
        The marriage of homemade pasta and Bolognese sauce is a match made in culinary heaven. As 
        the tender pasta noodles intertwine with the hearty sauce, they create a culinary experience that 
        is both comforting and satisfying. Each bite tells a story of tradition and craftsmanship, where 
        simple ingredients are transformed into a dish that evokes feelings of warmth and nostalgia. 
        Topped with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs, Homemade Pasta Bolognese 
        is more than just a meal â€“ it's a celebration of the rich tapestry of Italian cuisine, inviting diners to 
        savor each moment and indulge in the pleasures of homemade cooking.

    <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Homemade Pasta</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>On a clean work surface, mound 2 cups of all-purpose flour and create a well in the center.</li>
        <li>Crack 3 eggs into the well and lightly beat them with a fork.</li>
        <li>Gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After resting, roll out the dough thinly using a rolling pin or pasta machine.</li>
        <li>Cut the rolled-out dough into your desired shape for the pasta (e.g., fettuccine, tagliatelle).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Bolognese Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add 1 finely chopped onion, 1 diced carrot, and 1 diced celery stalk. Cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to medium-high and add 1/2 pound of ground beef and 1/2 pound of ground pork. Cook until browned, breaking up any large chunks with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1 can of diced tomatoes or 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, along with 1/2 cup of red wine (optional).</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup of beef or chicken broth, 1 bay leaf, and 1 teaspoon each of dried oregano, basil, and thyme.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the sauce simmer for at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a splash of milk or cream to thin it out.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Homemade Pasta</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Carefully add the homemade pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente, usually 2-3 minutes for fresh pasta.</li>
        <li>Drain the cooked pasta, reserving a cup of the pasta water.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 4: Combine the Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the pot with the Bolognese sauce.</li>
        <li>Toss the pasta and sauce together until the pasta is evenly coated.</li>
        <li>If the sauce seems too thick, you can add some of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Divide the Homemade Pasta Bolognese among serving plates or bowls.</li>
        <li>Garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh basil or parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious Homemade Pasta Bolognese!</li>
