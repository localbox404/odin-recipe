    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p class="pizzahit">Pizza is a beloved dish that originated in Italy but has become a global culinary phenomenon. At
        its core, pizza typically consists of a round, flattened dough base topped with various ingredients 
        such as tomato sauce, cheese, meats, vegetables, and herbs. The dough is usually made from 
        wheat flour, water, yeast, salt, and olive oil, creating a versatile base that can be customized to suit 
        a wide range of preferences. One of the defining features of pizza is its versatility, allowing for 
        endless combinations of toppings to suit different tastes and cultural influences.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cooking process typically involves baking the assembled pizza in a hot oven, often in a 
        traditional wood-fired oven or a modern pizza oven, until the crust is crispy and the toppings are 
        cooked to perfection. The result is a flavorful and satisfying dish that is enjoyed by people of all 
        ages around the world. Pizza has evolved over time to encompass various regional styles, from the 
        classic Neapolitan pizza with its thin crust and minimal toppings to the deep-dish pizza 
        popularized in the United States, known for its thick crust and generous layers of cheese and 
        toppings. Whether enjoyed as a quick and casual meal or as a gourmet dining experience, pizza 
        continues to hold a special place in the hearts (and stomachs) of food lovers everywhere.
